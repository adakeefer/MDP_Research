# MDP_Research
Contains the work I have done developing free open-source image processing software in my research lab.

Vast majority of the work is in Raster.cpp and Raster.h.  All my documentation is through doxygen.
This code relies on a large amount of external dependencies to run - gdal, boost, and hdf5 are the main libraries used.
Images included are for documentation and examples of the results of my code - feel free to look around.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to email me at keefera@umich.edu.
